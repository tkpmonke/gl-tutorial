# OpenGL Tutorial with a focus on GameDev
I haven't found many OpenGL tutorials with a focus on game development (I also didn't look), so I decided to make my own. 

I plan on turning these into videos (thats why they are called episodes and not chapters), but thats a little later.

Heres what I got planned for each chapter

  1. Triangles
  2. Matrices
  3. Pong
  4. 3D
  5. Textures
  6. Loading Models and Shaders From Disk
  7. Skyboxes

After these I'll see what I feel like making, as I'm not 100% sure yet
